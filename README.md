## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Surya Madhavan, Full stack developer from India. 
I like to develop things using code. I think of technologies as tools to be equipped and deployed while solving problems. 

Portfolio (Built with NextJS, TailwindCSS): [msurya.in](msurya.in)

Here is my journey so far:
- 2018 - 2019: Started with Full stack development. Learning courses, creating practice projects (some old repositories here can be ignored ðŸ˜„)
- 2019 - 2022: Joined @SIESGSTArena - Codechef College Chapter as Frontend Developer, Content Writer & Marketer. Indulged myself across all domains and worked hard to grow the chapter from 200+ to 1000+ audience. Soon became President for the chapter.
- 2020 - 2021: Interned at a Delhi based Recruitment Platform startup as React Developer. 
- 2021- 2022: Shifted onto Machine Learning / Deep Learning for my B.E. final year capstone project and developed a [Generative Adversarial Network Project implementing Virtual Try-On for fashion](https://resmilitaris.net/index.php/resmilitaris/article/view/2182).
- 2022 - 2024: Briefly did freelancing before joining Capgemini as Software Engineer. Worked as backend developer for Automotive client project based on **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**. Developed 2 POCs using **Angular, Kafka Streams**.
- Now: Started with my coding contributions through fellow projects, idea executions and looking for suitable full-time opportunities.

### Languages
While I try to stay technology agnostic, my experience lies around **Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React JS, Redux, NodeJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, SASS**.
